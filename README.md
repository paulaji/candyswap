Logic:
If 3/4 columns | 3/4 row have the same color/candy in succession, those can be popped.
By saying 3/4 rows/columns of same color/candy, we are calculating the successive widths of the cells in our board.

We have assigned each color/cell of the board/table to have a width of 8.

Case of three cells having the same color in succession:
If the width is 8 x 3 = 24 of the same color, it can be popped.
Case of four:
If the width is 8 x 4 = 32 of the same color, it can be popped.
